# Pulumi

Pulumi is an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure. Pulumi works with traditional infrastructure like VMs, networks, and databases, in addition to modern architectures, including containers, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless functions. Pulumi supports dozens of public, private, and hybrid cloud service providers.

## Repository

This repository includes my configurations that I made with Pulumi. Understanding the added values of having a framework as Pulumi and providing extended configurations.

## Azure

The initial Azure stack that I created is a simple stack and variants as adding a cluster. A default blueprint will be created using Pulumi and the sub-stacks can be used as add-ons to your environment.
